# SoC_AI_Race_Cars

Very ShortSummary of SoC AI-Race-Cars dated26/05/2022:

We first started with a course on Reinforcement Learning.
We learnt about Markov Processes and the terminology associated with the same.
We learnt about several methods of evaluating policies (like TDÎ» and TD(0) and MonteCarlo Evaluation).
Then we developed methods of comparing policies to arrive at the optimum policy.
Using the Bellman recursive relation we can update our policy as we move along iterations or at the end of an episode.
We then saw off-policy learning and took a general view of Model-free learning
The course concluded with a case study of some games which have been mastered by RL bots

We are learning to deal with Python libraries like matplotlib, numpy, OpenAIGym, tensorflow etc. 
We are using these libraries to build and run RL agents
We are mainly focusing on the Neural Network supported Q-Learning method of RL.
We are learning to run agents on self made as well as library environments.

We are coding stuff and playing around with RL. It's fun :)
